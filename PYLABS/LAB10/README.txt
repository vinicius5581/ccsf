Greetings Pythonistas,


Read about the lab here:

	http://hills.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/cs131a/tablelab.html

When you are done you will see a page similar to 

	http://hills.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/cgi-bin/tablelab/forbeswomen.py

MINOR CORRECTION: There was a typo in tablelab/cgiscript/forbeswomen.py
    about editing a file path. Corrected now. Thanks to Dan!

DUE DATE: Monday, April 20, 2015 at 11:59 pm.


Good luck everybody!

Ulf
