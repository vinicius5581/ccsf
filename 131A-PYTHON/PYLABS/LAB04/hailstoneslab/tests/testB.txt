>>> from hailstones import stones

Start with a nice even seed.

>>> seed = 32
>>> stones(seed)
[32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

>>> stones(5)
[5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]


What if the seed is 1 ?  Should stop right away.

>>> stones(1)
[1]

Now one of those seeds that goes on for a while.

>>> stones(7)
[7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
