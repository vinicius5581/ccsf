Note: This lab is due before the longer hailstoneslab LAB04. 

We read from a dictionary of words that is available on the hills system.

We look for a kind of words that we will call 'rewords'; words that are still words when reversed.

But, we don't want to include palindromes, so reversing the word must give a different word.    

    >>> is_reword('top')
    True

    >>> is_reword('pop')
    False

    >>> is_reword('whyask')
    False

Best documentation for both words.py an rewords.py is to read the two test files
tests/test_words.txt and tests/test_rewords.txt


The instructions are similar to LAB03 and LAB04.

Before submitting the assignment, replace the two lines with HERE 
by the result of the commands above it.

    $ finger -p `whoami`

    HERE

    $ date

    HERE

I will give instructions later on how to submit the labs to me.


Ulf
