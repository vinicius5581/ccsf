Subject:    CS131A:MESSAGE09: about QUIZ05 today (with Woody Allen quote)

Greetings Pythonistas,


Lot's of good work with your palindromelab programs, and you have been good sports working with the pine email program too!

Today's quiz will be different:  No python or unix questions. Honest. So no need to study for that this time.  Use your time to get started on PYLAB04 and then PYLAB05.

See you in class.  We will go over some of your programs and then cover new material.


Ulf
