This directory contains two python files:

wordreader.py
wordcounter.py

When we view them as modules we can do imports like

from wordreader import file2words
from wordcounter import

There is also a directory with tetst.

tests/testA.txt

Look at the file test.txt.  

If you run the command below, from inside this diretory
you should not see any output, unless the tests are wrong 
or something missing.

$ python3 testrunner

or 

$ ./testrunner
