Run this file from the command line by doing
$ python3 runmytests.txt

>>> file = 'tonguetwisters/howmuchwood.txt'
>>> from wordreader import file2words
>>> WORDS = file2words(file)
>>> 'woodchuck' in WORDS
True
>>> 'woody' in WORDS
False

How many words are there in that list?

>>> len(WORDS)
31

Now, let's get the word frequenecies in our list of WORDS.

>>> from wordcounter import wordfreqs
>>> d = wordfreqs(WORDS)
>>> type(d)
<class 'dict'>

It's a dict so the keys are in unpredictable order.
But, the built-in sorted actually , 
returns a sorted list of the keys in d..

>>> sorted(d)
['a', 'as', 'chuck', 'how', 'if', 'much', 'wood', 'woodchuck', 'would']

For each of those keys we can ask for the frequency in our file.

>>> d['woodchuck']
5

>>> d['wood'], d['would']
(4, 5)
