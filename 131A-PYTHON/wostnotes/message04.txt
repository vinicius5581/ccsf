Subject: CS131A:MESSAGE04: QUIZ03 and wostnotes


Greetings CS131A Students,

It's been fun to finger you on hills, and to see your cool webpages showing up at 

    http://hills.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/cgi-bin/homepages.py

We have our usual weekly quiz at 6:00pm.  As usual review your notes and the wostnotes in detail.

The reading assignments are as usual at 

    http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/reading/

The class home page is still at 

    http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner

No big surprises on the quiz, just testing your understanding of what we have covered so far.

Ulf


P.S.  I have also added wostnotes08.  Not asking you to learn the code in there now, 
but it does review how functions are defined and some string and list methods 
and functions.  If you take a look at it before class it can be easier to follow the lecture about it.
