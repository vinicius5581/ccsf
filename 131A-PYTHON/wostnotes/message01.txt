Greetings Python Students,

This is the first message to CS131A. 

It was good to meet you all in class.

Some information and reminders:

(1) CLASS HOME PAGE:  http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner
    
    That page gets updated often. Find information about almost everything there.

(2) WOSTNOTES:

    On hills there is a directory that you can enter using the cd command,
    list the files there, and read the notes, messages etc that get added there.

     The directory is 

        /users/uwostner/wostnotes/

        ~uwostner/wostnotes


(3) READING:

    To help you read and connect the book material with our lectures,
    I have created an "annotated" table of contents for the book.
    The blue colored sections you should read.  Not so many yet, but it will grow each week.
    The small text items are comments that I make about some of the sections.
   
    http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/reading

    We will refer to that file every lecture in the future.

(4) INTERACTIVE SHELL SESSION:

    In class we worked with the interactive python shell, entering command after command.
    The very best python activity for you right now is to review all those commands,
    and try to PREDICT the output in each case. To make that easier the first time
    I have created a file with those commands.  

    Study like this:  
 
       In each case write down your PREDICTION of what the output would be.
        Like for 
        >>> 3**2
        
        You expect the output 9, right.

        Each time VERIFY using the interactive python3 shell so see if you got the right answer!

        It's a game, really, and it will teach you a lot.

        The file is on hills.ccsf.edu in

        ~uwostner/wostnotes/wostnotes01.txt

  
(5) DID YOU LOG IN YET?  LEARN THE BASICS OF UNIX and the PICO EDITOR?  Most of you already have

    but we would like to have everybody onboard and succeed in the class.

    You need those basics to get on hills and read those things in the wostnotes directory.
    
    Reminder: Our class home page has links to  ACRC with workshops or handouts, etc.


Good luck everybody!
