>>> from cards import RANKS, SUITS
>>> from cardindices import suit_index, rank_index

Let's take a look again at the lists of card SUIST and RANKS.

>>> SUITS
['C', 'D', 'H', 'S']

>>> RANKS
['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']

Now, check the index of some suits.

>>> suit_index('C')
0
>>> suit_index('S')
3

And then, the index of some ranks.

>>> rank_index('A')
12
>>> rank_index('2')
0
>>> rank_index('10')
8

>>> from cardindices import rank_first_tuple

>>> rank_first_tuple('QH')
(10, 2)
>>> rank_first_tuple('KH')
(11, 2)
>>> rank_first_tuple('AH')
(12, 2)
>>> rank_first_tuple('AS')
(12, 3)
>>> rank_first_tuple('10D')
(8, 1)

>>> from cardindices import suit_first_tuple

>>> suit_first_tuple('2S')
(3, 0)
>>> suit_first_tuple('QH')
(2, 10)
>>> suit_first_tuple('KH')
(2, 11)
>>> suit_first_tuple('AH')
(2, 12)
>>> suit_first_tuple('AS')
(3, 12)
>>> suit_first_tuple('10D')
(1, 8)
