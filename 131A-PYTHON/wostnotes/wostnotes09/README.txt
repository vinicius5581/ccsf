These are programs that we wrote together in class,
 with Nehemiah doing a great job at the controls.

These programs are like experiments where we explore how 
to read a file and extract the words, and finally 
do a frequency count.

We also practiced some formatting to print the frequencies nicely.

Note: Study these files and run the programs too, like we did in class.

Then, study, the paper handouts from class where we showed 
how to really organize your work as a package "wordy"
that contains modules like "wordreader" and "wordcounter",
and how we do imports and even testing there.
