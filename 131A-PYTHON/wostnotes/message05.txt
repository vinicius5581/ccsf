Subject: CS131A:MESSAGE05: posted notes and scores


Greetings CS131A Students,

(1) The notes from the lecture this week, with Nehemiah doing a great job at the computer, are now 
in wostnotes09.   Read those files and to recall the main ideas from the lecture.

(2) Read the handouts from class and compare with the files in wostnotes08.  Itâ€™s closely related to (1) above,
but organized in a more advanced way using functions, modules, and tests.  The package is named wordy, 
the modules are named wordreader and wordcounter. 

(3) Learn what you can from (2), and we will go into more detail next lecture.

(4) I posted your quiz and lab scores at our class home page.

(5) Check http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/reading to see the sections of our textbook that you will have read by the quiz next week.

(6) Our  pythonista pages on hills are at http://hills.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/cgi-bin/homepages.py 

(7) This message, and other messages are also in the wostnotes directory.  If there are minor changes or corrections they will be made there.


Keep up the good work everybody,


Ulf
