>>> from hailstones import stones
>>> import height
>>> import length

---------------------------------
Look at a nice little seed. 
The stones go up and then down down.
---------------------------------

>>> seed = 5

>>> stones(seed)
[5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

>>> height.measure(seed)
16

>>> length.measure(seed)
6

---------------------------------
Here is a seed that hits an air pocket
and just keeps dropping and dropping.
---------------------------------

>>> seed = 256
>>> stones(seed)
[256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

>>> length.measure(seed)
9

>>> height.measure(seed)
256

---------------------------------
If the seed is 1 the stones process already stopped.
---------------------------------

>>> seed = 1
>>> stones(seed)
[1]

>>> length.measure(seed)
1
>>> height.measure(seed)
1

---------------------------------
Here is a more a surprising seed.
---------------------------------

>>> seed = 27

That seed gives so many stones we skip some in the list below.

>>> stones(seed)
[27, 82, 41, 124,..., 9232,..., 8, 4, 2, 1]

The seed was not big but the stones reached an amazing height.

>>> height.measure(seed)
9232

The list of stones actually has 112 stones.
Not bad for a small seed like 27.

>>> length.measure(seed)
112
