>>> from triples import triples

>>> minseed, maxseed = 1, 7

>>> triples(minseed, maxseed)
[(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (3, 8, 16), (4, 3, 4), (5, 6, 16), (6, 9, 16), (7, 17, 52)]

How about seeds ranging from 25 to 30?

>>> triples(25, 30)
[(25, 24, 88), (26, 11, 40), (27, 112, 9232), (28, 19, 52), (29, 19, 88), (30, 19, 160)]


Now, let's watch those records being broken.

>>> from records import lengthrecords
>>> lengthrecords(20)
[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 8), (6, 9), (7, 17), (9, 20), (18, 21)]

>>> from records import heightrecords
>>> heightrecords(20)
[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 16), (7, 52), (15, 160)]

Any new height records if we try seeds up to 26?

>>> heightrecords(26)
[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 16), (7, 52), (15, 160)]

OK, so no new records. Let's try seeds up to 27.

>>> heightrecords(27)
[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 16), (7, 52), (15, 160), (27, 9232)]

How about that?  Huge new record for seed at 27.
