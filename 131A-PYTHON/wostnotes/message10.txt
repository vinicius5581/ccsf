Good job on LAB04 and LAB05.  Not easy.

Since these are longer labs I will accept solutions for full credit until 5 pm today, Tuesday.

And, after we discussed some of the solutions in class, I will still accept LAB04 and LAB05 for 50% credit until Thursday Feb 26 at 11:59pm.

I drop the lowest lab score and the lowest quiz score when adding up the scores for the midterm grade.

I drop the two lowest lab scores and the two lowest quiz scores when adding up the scores for the course grade.

There are more labs around the corner, and some of them will be quite a bit easier too.
