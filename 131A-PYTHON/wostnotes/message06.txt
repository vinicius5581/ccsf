Subject: CS131A:MESSAGE06: quiz04 results, more wostnotes, etc

Correction: The email I sent out said you're working on LAB01.
            Make that LAB03, and I'm preparing LAB04 and LAB05.


Greetings Pythonistas,

Good scores overall.  Your results are posted as usual at

It takes a while to understand the while loops.  No wonder they are called while loops.

The sessions at the computer last night by Michail and by Nehemiah are now wostnotes11, after some editing.  Study those.

You are all working on LAB03 now.  I will let you know how to submit your work, probably by the weekend.  The deadline is Monday evening.

I am preparing LAB04 and LAB05 and will let you know when you can start working on them.

Good luck with the programming,

Ulf
