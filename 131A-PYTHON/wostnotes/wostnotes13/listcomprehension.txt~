Optional Topic:  List comprehensions.

Here are a few examples of list comprehension.

>>> BLANK = ''

>>> [c for c in "hello4!3?"]

>>> [c for c in "hello4!3?" if c.isalpha() ]

>>> BLANK.join([c for c in "hello4!3?" if c.isalpha() ])

>>> BLANK.join([c for c in "hello4!3?" if c.isalpha() or c == '4'])


>>> [x**2 for x in range(10)]


>>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(10)]
