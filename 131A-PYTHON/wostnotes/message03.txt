Greetings CS131A,

(1)  I have posted on hills new wostnotes based on the lectures last night.

(2) Started looking at your quizzes from last night. Here are the questions:

    http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/myquiz02.html

(3)   Learning loops takes time. Read your lecture notes, wostnotes, and the quiz questions, again.  

(4)   The book reading assignments are here:  http://fog.ccsf.edu/~uwostner/reading/

(4)   Get your python interpreter shell out on hills, on your own machine, and then practice, practice, and practice some more.

    $ python3
        >>> practicepracticepractice
    

(5) This week I will mail out a couple of assignments.  You will always have one week to complete smaller assignments,
    and two weeks for bigger assignments.

(6) You can start creating a web page on hills now, following how we did that in class. 


Itâ€™s a pleasure teaching you all!

Keep up the good work.

Ulf
