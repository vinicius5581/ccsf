Greetings Pythonistas,

I see many of you on hills working away on the LAB assignments already!  Good going.


Here is a summary of the assignments, with their DUE DATES etc.

NOTE: SINCE LAB04 (not 05)  IS KIND OF LONG THAT ONE IS DUE LAST.


LAB03   palindromelab   DUE DATE: Monday Feb 16 2015 at 11:59pm

then,

LAB05   wordslab        DUE DATE: Saturday Feb 21 2015 at 11:59pm


and then, the longer lab, where you make as many of the tests work as you can.


LAB04   hailstonelab    DUE DATE: Monday Feb 23 2015 at 11:59pm.


Careful with the DUE DATEs.  You can still get up to half as many points the day after, but it depends.

We are still working on the best way for you to actually submitting your labs to me, so hang on to them,
and run those tests !

Good luck everybody,

Ulf
