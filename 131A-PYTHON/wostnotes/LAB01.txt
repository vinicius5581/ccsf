Greetings CS131A,

This LAB01 is about using your Unix and Pico editor skills to give people useful info when they finger you on hills.

Since you already have taken the basic Unix workshop and Pico editor (or some other editor on hills), this will take about ONE HOUR to complete. 

Deadline: Complete before next lecture, so before Quiz03 on Tuesday.

For a couple of examples, you can finger me, or Tim in our class with

$ finger uwostner
    
$ finger tdillar3

Step 1:  Use the chfn command (change finger command) on hills, and answer the questions there. Main thing is your name, and for office 
just enter your ccsf email address.  Skip phone numbers.   

Then, verify that it looks OK using

$ finger -p yourlognamehere

You can compare yours to what you see when doing

$ finger -p uwostner
$ finger -p tdillar3


Step 2:  Create a file named .project where you put ONE LINE ONLY describing your current project, like maybe what classes your are  taking.

That line should now show up when you do 

$ finger yourlognamehere

Step 3:  Create a longer file named .plan where you can write more information about your work, your interests, etc.  Again, for examples look at 

$ finger uwostner
    
$ finger tdillar3
    

Step 4:  IMPORTANT.   You can see your own finger information.  But can other people on hills see it?  You need to have permissions like Timâ€™s below.
His homer has x permission for all, and his .project and .plan files have r for all.

$ ls -dl ~tdillar3
drwx--x--x 21 tdillar3 b20147 4096 Jan 28 20:29 /students/tdillar3/

$ ls -l ~tdillar3/.project
-rw-r--r-- 1 tdillar3 b20147 75 Sep 20 20:25 /students/tdillar3/.project

$ ls -l ~tdillar3/.plan
-rw-r--r-- 1 tdillar3 b20147 283 Sep 24 10:47 /students/tdillar3/.plan

Step 5:  Reply to this email to let me know that you have finished the assignment.  Tip:  Ask someone else to finger you first.  If the permissions are OK they can then see the info in your .project and .plan. 

( Next LAB assignment will be to create a very basic home page on hills, see wostnotes07. )

Good luck everybody, looking forward to checking your info out on hills!

Ulf
