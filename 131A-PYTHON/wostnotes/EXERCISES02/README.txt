Greetings CS131A Students,

Here you find many practice questions that are similar to your lecture notes and reading.


How to answer the questions:

    Copy the questions file to your home directory.

    Open the file there with your favorite editor, like pico.

    Type in your answers to the questions and save the file in your home directory.

    Good idea to verify things using the python interpreter too.

    $ python3
    >>> practice,practice,practice


There is also a file with answers here and it will be readable at some other time.
