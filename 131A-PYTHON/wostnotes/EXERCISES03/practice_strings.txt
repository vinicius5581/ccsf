Good QUIZ preparation.  You might find more files like this before next quiz.


>>> s = "2what4now-454  "

>>> s.strip()

Did s change?

>>> s

>>> s.strip('45')

>>>

>>> t = s.strip('45')

>>> len(s)


>>> s.replace('4', '-')

Did s change?

>>> s

>>> u = "Hello\tWorld"

>>> len(u)

>>> print(u)

>>> u.replace('\t', '    ')

Did u change?

>>> u

Now try some other str methods. 


>>> v = "Did you read Catch 22?"

>>> v.isalnum()

>>> w = v[:-1]

>>> w

>>> w.isalnum()

>>> w.isalpha()

>>> BLANK, SPACE = '', ' '

>>> len(BLANK), len(SPACE)
>>> x = w.replace(SPACE, BLANK)

>>> x

>>> x.isalnum()

>>> x.isalpha()

>>> y = x.upper()

>>> y

>>> g = "Heard of ABBA be4?"

>>> g.lower()


All characters have a number. Memorize these.

>>> ord('A'), ord('a'), ord(SPACE)

You can get the character from its number.

>>> chr(65), chr(66), chr(67)

>>> chr(ord('?'))

>>> for n in range(65, 69):
...     print(chr(n))

What is the number for the non-English character in the string below?

>>> gonsalves = "Rob GonÃ§alves"

>>>

And just for fun, this is the (lunar) year of the ...

>>> chr(32650)


You may or may not see something interesting, depending on
what fonts are on your computer.

-------------------- 

Now, some more technical bonus material about using the string methods
str.maketrans() and str.translate()

You can use two strings of equal length to create what's called a 
translation table.  It's really just a dict.

>>> mytrans = str.maketrans("AB4", 'ba5')

Take a guess at what it looks like.

>>> mytrans

>>> type(mytrans)

Now use that with the translate method for str.

>>> g.translate(mytrans)
