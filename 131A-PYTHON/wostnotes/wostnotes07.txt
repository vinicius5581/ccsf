Hello CS131A folks,

The text below is the HTML code for a basic webpage.

STEP 1: 
Create a directory public_html and make that directory x for other.

STEP 2:
Inside public_html create a file with name index.html
and put the html code below into that file, like we did in class.
Make your index.html readable by other.

STEP 3:
Check that you can view it using the URL

    http://hills.ccsf.edu/~emusk01  ( for Elon Musk, but user your own login name)

STEP 4:

Create a directory ~/public_html/images
and make it x for other.

STEP 5:
Find some suitable image somewhere and download it into that directory,
so now you would have a file

    ~/public_html/images/yourimagehere.png

STEP 6:
Give that image file the permission r for other.

STEP 7:
View your webpage in a web browser again to see that the image also looks OK.

STEP 8:
Reply to this email when your page, inlcuding the image, is working.

Deadline: Complete by Wedneday Feb 4.


There are hundreds of good basic html tutorials on the web
where you can learn how to add images, lists, tables, etc to your page.

Later in the course we will write some python programs that create interesting hills web pages.

Good luck,

Ulf
