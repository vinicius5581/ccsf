Greetings CS131A Students,

We have worked on different ways to submit LAB03, and this is what we have decided:

The deadline for LAB03 has been extended to Tuesday Feb 17 at 1:00pm.


How to submit LAB03.

(1) Go into your PYLABS directory on hills.

    $ cd ~/PYLABS


(2) Create a so-called "tarball" from your LAB03

    $ tar czvf LAB03.tgz LAB03

(3) You should now see a file LAB03.tgz next to your LAB03 directory.
    
    $ ls LAB03.tgz


(4) Send that tarball LAB03.tgz to me on hills.  Here is how:

(5) Start the pine mail program on hills.

    $ pine

(6) If you never used pine before it might ask to you to "enter" by typing E.

(7) In pine you might see a list of messages. One of them is this message.

It has subject 

    Subject: CS131A:LAB03:palindromelab

(8) Type R to reply.

(9) You will see a field

    Attachment:

(10) IMPORTANT: In the attachment field enter you need to have

    Attachment: LAB03.tgz

(11) Use ^X to send the message (just like when you quit the pico editor).

(12) When you are done with pine, type q to quit.

(13) I extended the deadline to 1:00 pm  Tuesday February 17.

Looking forward to seeing your programs!

Ulf
