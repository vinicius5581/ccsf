Greetings CS131A Students,

Here you find many of the questions from our QUIZ03, with several added questions for more practice.

There is also a file with answers here and it will be readable at some other time.

How to answer the questions:

    Copy the questions file to your home directory.
    Open the file there with your favorite editor, like pico.

    Type in your answers to the questions and save the file in your home directory.

This is very good practice and review for the next quiz too.
