Read the description of the altgeld tables in the notes for unit 03
The data values  in these inserts might not exactly match the data values shown in the notes. You can run the demos to check the current values in the tables.

Before running these scripts you need to have created the databases: a_emp, a_prd, a_oe.


Treat these as scripts and run from the command line- this is easier and less error prone than using copy and paste.

The order for running the scripts is
Check that you have created the databases and have the proper permissions.
1.  run the create script - it will remove any previous copy of the tables you might have.
2.  run the inserts script - it will delete any data from the tables and then do the inserts.
  If later in the semester you want to get back to the original set of data and you have not dropped any of the tables, you can just run the inserts script.
Scripts: if you are running these as scripts you can send the output to an LST file.
